## Sales Trend Analysis: Analyze monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends.
Top Products & Categories: Identify the top-performing products, categories, and regions.
Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on purchase behavior.
Profit Margin Analysis: Evaluate profit margins across products and customer segments.
Forecasting: Provide forecasts for upcoming sales periods (if applicable).
Design Decisions or Assumptions
Key assumptions and design choices:

## Data Cleaning: Removed outliers in Sales and Profit to ensure accurate analysis.
Segmentation Criteria: Used purchase frequency and average order value for customer segmentation.
Assumption: Seasonal trends may impact sales, so time-series decomposition was used in the analysis.
